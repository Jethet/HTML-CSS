STYLING WEBSITES

CSS defines the visual representation of the content of a website, such as
colour, margins, borders, backgrounds and positions in the page. CSS is the
presentation of the website, where HTML is the structure.

CSS rule:
body {
  color: xxxx;
}
'body' is the selector, 'color' is the property and 'xxx' is the value:
general code is
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  property: value;
  ( ... etc. ...)
}

A group of properties for a given selector is always defined within the curly
braces, as shown above.

Style tag: code
  <style type="xxxxx">

  </style>
