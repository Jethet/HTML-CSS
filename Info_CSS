STYLING WEBSITES

CSS defines the visual representation of the content of a website, such as
colour, margins, borders, backgrounds and positions in the page. CSS is the
presentation of the website, where HTML is the structure.

Selector: element
example of CSS rule:
body {
  color: xxxx;
}
'body' is the selector, 'color' is the property and 'xxx' is the value:
general code is
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  property: value;
  ( ... etc. ...)
}

A group of properties for a given selector is always defined within the curly
braces, as shown above.

A style tag is added in the header of the HTML code. In this tag, the code for
all styling is wrapped:

  <style type="xxxxx">
    selector {
      property: value;
      property: value;
      (... etc. ...)
    }
  </style>

Text decoration includes underline, overline and line-through.

Selector: class
A class selector selects all elements that use the specified class.
'margin' is the area surrounding an element: top, bottom, right, left.

Selector: id
The id selector selects the element with the id. There can be only one
element with a particular id.

Selector: nested elements
This selects all elements of a type that are nested within a class

CSS can be embedded in the HTML page. This means it cannot be reused
across other pages. A better way is to define CSS and include it
within a SEPARATE STYLESHEET. This can then be reused.
NB: both the HTML page and CSS stylesheet must be in the SAME directory.

COMMENTS IN CSS: use /*place your comments here*/
