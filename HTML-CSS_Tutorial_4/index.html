        Grace Hopper was born in 1906. Her parents, noticing her interest in math,
        made special arrangements for her to take classes reserved for boys in school.
        She received a Bachelors degree in Mathematics and physics from Vassar college
        and then moved on to Yale,, where she did her Masters degree in Math. She
        continued her education and began a teaching career at Vassar. When she
        received her PhD, she joined the navy where she was assigned to work in the
        Bureau of Ordinance computation project at Harvard University. There, she
        became part of the programming team that worked on the Mark I, the first
        computer ever made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her work with the navy and computers did not end until 1966, when she was
        asked to retire. That did not last for very long. A couple of months later,
        she was asked to return to work with COBOL, the first standardised
        programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout her childhood, she had a fascination with both math and the navy.
        She was able to join the navy after acquiring waivers for the weight and
        height requirements, and rapidly climbed the ranks. By the time she started
        working on the Mark I, she was already a lieutenant.
        The demanding environment and high expectations of her at the navy helped
        her thrive. This was for her the perfect work environment. She was also the
        one who wrote the operating manual for the Mark I. In 1949, she left the
        navy to continue working with computers, and returned in 1967 to teach
        young people about them. She loved teaching about computers as much as she
        loved working with them. Young people for her were the future.

        Grace loved the Navy and was reluctant to retire, even at the age of 79.
        At her retirement ceremony, she was recognised for all she contributed,
        and she received the Distinguished Service Medal of the Defense Department,
        the department's highest honour, and a citation which stated:
      <blockquote>
        Rear Admiral Hopper's personal dedication, technical expertise and
        broad-based knowledge of the computers were a cornerstone of the Navy's
        continuing development of Information Systems technology. She is one of
        the Navy's most effective public speakers and a sought-after adviser
        on the subject of automatic data processing.
      </blockquote>
      </p>

        Some of her greatest achievements were creating the term <b>debug</b>, a
        term used today to mean fixing the coding errors in a program, by taking
        a moth out of the Mark I, developing the first compiler, which paved the
        way for modern computer languages, and creating Flow-Matic: a computer
        language that recognised 20 English phrases and interpreted them into
        machine code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grace also wrote the first compiler, which enabled a programmer to use
        words instead of arithmetic, a startling concept for those days. A
        compiler is now essential in programming languages, and shortens the
        time it takes to programme into days or hours rather than months.

        <em>Her contributions are invaluable</em>
