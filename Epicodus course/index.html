    <h2>Is there life over 50?</h2>

    <p>Career changes are only happening among young people. In the Netherlands where I was born, most people who lose their job at the age of 45 or over will have difficulty finding a job. While the government expects people <strong>to continue working until they are almost 68,</strong> businesses are not really interested in people over 45. There are some huge prejudices against employees over 45:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>they report sick more often</li>
      <li>when sick, they are sick for a longer period of time</li>
      <li>there is even a risk of them not returning to work at all due to some old people's illness/ailment/disorder/handicap/whatever....</li>
      <li>they are slower in executing their tasks</li>
      <li>they do not pick up new developments</li>
      <li>their education and knowledge are outdated</li>
      <li>they do not want to participate in training or courses to learn new competencies</li>
      <li>they are expensive and expect higher salaries due to their years of experience</li>
      <li>they cannot keep up with the younger employees</li>
      <li> ..... need we go on? Have a look at this article: <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/washed-up-at-50-age-discrimination">Washed-up at 50 in the Netherlands</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>No wonder an employer will think twice before hiring someone who is 50 years old. <strong>These people are a threat,</strong> that's obvious, also looking at the way they are portrayed in the media.</p>
    <p>It seems to be different in Spain, where I live now. Many people in shops, restaurants and companies seem to be at least 45 if not 'older'. Maybe it has to do with the low birthrate? Maybe Spanish people over 50 are not sick so often?</p>
    <p>In the United States, the situation is much the same as in the Netherlands, with official rights for workers over 50. Think about it: we need a law to protect the right to fair treatment in the workplace (regarding things such as the employer making training available, not indicating a preferred age in vacancy announcements, offering the same benefits, etc.) of people over 50. When you're 37, this obviously is not necessary. Is there a good reason for this or are we stuck with the prejudices? Age discrimination appears to be the problem in the US: check out this article: <a href="https://legalbeagle.com/7185576-rights-over-50-years-old.html">Rights over 50 years old</a>.
