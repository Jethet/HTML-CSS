    <h1>Coding @60</h1>
    <h2>Is there life over 50?</h2>
    <p>Career changes are only happening among young people. In the Netherlands, most people who lose their job at the age of 45 or over will have difficulty finding a job. While the government expects people to continue working until they are almost 68, businesses are not really interested in people over 45. There are some huge prejudices against employees over 45:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>they report sick more often</li>
      <li>when sick, they are sick for a longer period of time</li>
      <li>there is even a risk of them not returning to work at all due to some old people's illness/ailment/disorder/handicap/whatever....</li>
      <li>they are slower in executing their tasks</li>
      <li>they do not pick up new developments</li>
      <li>their education and knowledge are outdated</li>
      <li>they do not want to participate in training or courses to learn new competencies</li>
      <li>they are expensive and expect higher salaries due to their years of experience</li>
      <li>they cannot keep up with the younger employees</li>
      <li> ..... need we go on?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No wonder an employer will think twice before hiring someone who is 50 years old. These people are a threat, that's obvious looking at the way they are portrayed in the media.</p>
    <p>It seems to be different in Spain, where many people in shops, restaurants and companies seem to be at least 45 if not 'older'. Maybe it has to do with the low birthrate? Maybe Spanish people over 50 are not sick so often?</p>
