  <h1>This course is free....</h1>
  <body>
    <p>.... and that can be explained by the terrible quality of the course.
        It really is not a course at all.</p>
    <div class="">
      <p>I do not mind working on a course but this is rather ridiculous.
      Apart from the fact that it is difficult to understand the teacher,
      it is also basic to the point that it is useless.</p>
