<!-- This is the basic setup of a proper HTML page -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

  <head>
    <!-- Inside 'head' we put tags that are essential to creating a web page.
     These do not appear on the web page but help the browser display it properly.
     The head tag contains special tags that define the document properties. The
     following are used:
     title - determines the page title, displayed in the browser. It is one of
     the key factors for SEO.
     script - used to add JavaScript into the page: <script>....some JS...</script>
