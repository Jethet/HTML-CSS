WEBPAGE STRUCTURE

-  doctype needs to be defined first in an HTML page: it tells the
   browser which version of HTML the page is using
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      </html>

-  head and body tags: a HTML page is split into two parts, head and body
   the head contains important webpage information (title, stylesheet, script)
   the body contains the webpage content that is visible to the user
