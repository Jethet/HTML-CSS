WEBPAGE STRUCTURE

-  doctype needs to be defined first in an HTML page: it tells the
   browser which version of HTML the page is using. The code is:
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      </html>

-  head and body tags: a HTML page is split into two parts, head and body
   the head contains important webpage information (title, stylesheet, script)
   the body contains the webpage content that is visible to the user.
   The code is:
     <head>
        <title>THIS IS THE TITLE</title>
        ... etc.
     </head>
     <body>
     </body>

-  elements: Headings
   There are 6 sizes for headings. The code is:
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <h2>Heading</h2>
    etc.
    h1 defines the largest (= most important) heading and h6 the smallest.

-  elements: Paragraph
   Use <p> to put content into paragraphs. It will break up your text and
   make it easier to read for the user. Code (after code for header):
     <p>
     </p>

-  element: Link
   A link lets the user click through to another webpage. The attribute
   href is used to indicate where the user should go. Code:
   <a href="https://..url and page of website..">..description reference..</a>

-  element: Div
   A div tag groups elements together. This is useful for styling (e.g.
   giving the grouped elements the same colour). Code to wrap around elements:
   <div>
   </div>

-  element: List
   Two types of list: ordered with numbers (= ol) and unordered with bullets
   (= ul). Code (same for ul):
   <ol>
     <li>item 1</li>
     <li>item 2</li>
     etc.
   </ol>

-  element: Image
   There should be a folder for images in the project folder. The images can
   be downloaded by right clicking on a link and select 'Save as ...', and
   save the images to the image folder.
   Images have three primary attributes:
   * the <img> tag
   * the src attribute that lets the page know what image the user wants to see
   * the alt attribute that provides extra information if the image cannot be
     seen on the webpage for any reason (name image??)
   To see the image on the webpage, the image needs to be linked by telling
   the webpage where the image is and what it is called. Code:
    <div>
      <img src="images/logo.png" alt="codebar.io">
    </div>
