-  comments that should be ignored in HTML code:
   Use special tag to add notes that will be ignored:
     <!-- Note to self: xxx xxx -->

WEBPAGE STRUCTURE

-  doctype needs to be defined first in an HTML page: it tells the
   browser which version of HTML the page is using. The code is:
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      </html>

-  head and body tags:
   a HTML page is split into two parts, head and body. The head contains
   important webpage information (title, stylesheet, script, font etc.).
   The body contains the webpage content that is visible to the user.
   The code is:
     <head>
        <title>THIS IS THE TITLE</title>
        ... etc.
     </head>
     <body>
     </body>

-  container: this is where the main content is specified, after the header.

-  elements: Headings
   There are 6 sizes for headings. The code is:
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <h2>Heading</h2>
    etc.
    h1 defines the largest (= most important) heading and h6 the smallest.

-  elements: Paragraph
   Use <p> to put content into paragraphs. It will break up your text and
   make it easier to read for the user. Code (after code for header):
     <p>
     </p>

-  element: Link
   A link lets the user click through to another webpage. The attribute
   href is used to indicate where the user should go. Code:
   <a href="https://..url and page of website..">..description reference..</a>

-  element: Div
   A div tag groups elements together. This is useful for styling (e.g.
   giving the grouped elements the same colour). Code to wrap around elements:
   <div>
   </div>

-  element: List
   Two types of list: ordered with numbers (= ol) and unordered with bullets
   (= ul). Code (same for ul):
   <ol>
     <li>item 1</li>
     <li>item 2</li>
     etc.
   </ol>

-  element: Image
   There should be a folder for images in the project folder. The images can
   be downloaded by right clicking on a link and select 'Save as ...', and
   save the images to the image folder.
   Images have three primary attributes:
   * the <img> tag
   * the src attribute that lets the page know what image the user wants to see
   * the alt attribute that provides extra information if the image cannot be
     seen on the webpage for any reason (name image??)
   To see the image on the webpage, the image needs to be linked by telling
   the webpage where the image is and what it is called. Code:
    <div>
      <img src="images/logo.png" alt="codebar.io">
    </div>

   It is possible to link to a video and combine this with pictures.
   First the link to the video should be added (with code <a href="">) and
   images of pictures can be added under this (small indent).

-  formatting:
   to emphasise text: use <em>
   to format text as important: use <strong>
   to format text small: use <small>

-  mailto link:
   A link can open up a user's email client and share content. The difference
   between regular links and mailto links is the content defined in the href
   attribute. Code:
    <a href="mailto:social&codebar.io?subject=I%20love%20owls%20::%20codebar">Email us</a>
   Note: spaces in the subject text are replaced by %20.

-  Twitter link:
   A share-on-Twitter link can be added as follows:
   <a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=I love owls! via @codebar">
      Share your love of owls on Twitter</a>

PSEUDO CLASS
A pseudo class is a keyword added to selectors to specify a special STATE. In
this way, different styling can be specified for different states of a link:
a:link
a:visited
a:hover
a:active
This ORDER should be followed to apply different styling for all of the states.
