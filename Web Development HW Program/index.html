    <h1>Web development course for simple people</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Just start an example web page to try out some of the functionality.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Using the different tags shows the differences in size of headings</h2>
    <br>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/international">Available for everyone, funded by readers
    (this is a blockquote)</blockquote>
    <br>
    <p>To show the various options, here we write in <strong>strong</strong> and after
    that we use dfn as <dfn>another tag</dfn>, which marks the introduction of a new
    word. Then there is <b>this b tag</b> that adds emphasis. The same can be done using
    the elements that are referred to as <em>em</em> and <i>i</i> tags, or the <mark>mark
    tag</mark>. Although highlighting can be achieved with CSS, using the mark tag gives
    an indication to screen readers and web crawlers that this is important. One last
    element is the<q> q element</q>, which automatically inserts quotation marks around
    the text inside of the tags.</p>
    <p>All these tags are part of semantic HTML.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is an example of an unordered list</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Item one</li>
        <li>Item two (surprise)</li>
        <li>Item three (exactly)</li>
        <li>Item four (boring)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Now the title of the list has a dot as well as the list items. This should be
    done differently.<br>
    <p>This is an example of an ordered list:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Item one</li>
      <li>Item two (surprise)</li>
      <li>Item three (exactly)</li>
      <li>Item four (boring)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The ul and ol lists can be used differently when lists are nested:</p>
    <br>This list will have a nested list:
      <ol>
      <li>First some list items</li>
      <li>Some more list items</li>
      <li>And here the next list starts:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>There are items all over the place</li>
        <li>Could be handy but does not look it</li>
        <li>Maybe go back to the other level</li>
      </ul>
      <li>So back to the original list</li>
      <li>Enough lists for one day</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Forgot one: the description list, consisting of description terms (dt)
    and description definition (dd) elements. Example:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Phrasal template word game</dt>
      <dd>This is a word game in shich one player prompts another for a list of words
      to subsitute for blanks in a story.</dd>
      <dt>Listicle</dt>
      <dd>A short-form of writing that uses a list as its thematic structure</dd>
    </dl>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Images can be used as inline block elements: they line up next to each other:</p>
      <img src="images/code_1.png" alt="Euro sign">
      <img src="images/code_2" alt="Some code">
      
    </div>
