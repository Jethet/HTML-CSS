    <p>To show the various options, here we write in <strong>strong</strong> and after
    that we use dfn as <dfn>another tag</dfn>, which marks the introduction of a new
    word. Then there is <b>this b tag</b> that adds emphasis. The same can be done using
    the elements that are referred to as <em>em</em> and <i>i</i> tags, or the <mark>mark
    tag</mark>. Although highlighting can be achieved with CSS, using the mark tag gives
    an indication to screen readers and web crawlers that this is important. One last
    element is the<q> q element</q>, which automatically inserts quotation marks around
    the text inside of the tags.</p>
    <p>All these tags are part of semantic HTML.</p>
