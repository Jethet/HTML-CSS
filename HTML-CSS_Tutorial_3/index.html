      <p>My name is August Ada King. I'm the Countess of Lovelace.</p>
      <p>I am a mathematician and a writer. People know me from my work on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage's </a>
        early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. I wrote the
        first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. In other words,
        <span class="highlight">I am the world's first programmer.</span></p>
      <p>My mother, Anne Isabella Byron, was a great help to me as she helped me
        by promoting my interest in mathematics and logic, but I also never forgot
        my dad, who moved to Greece when I was just an infant to help out in the
        civil war.</p>
      <blockquote>&ldquo;I do not believe that my father was such a poet as I shall be
        an Analyst; for with me the two go together indissolubly.%rdquo;</blockquote>
      <p>Throughout my life, mathematics have been my primary interest. I always
       question even basic assumptions by integrating poetry, another great love
       of mine, and science. I also have a keen interest in scientific
       developments and trends of my era like phrenology and mesmerism</p>
